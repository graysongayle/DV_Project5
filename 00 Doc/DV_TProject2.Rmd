First We created a **.Rprofile.R ** document at the same level as our R script to run the needed packages. This document includes the packages required for the project.
Below is the path to the .Rprofile document, and shows the loaded packages:

```{r}
source("../.Rprofile.R", echo = FALSE)
``` 

DATA Summary

```{r}
  superstore <-read.csv("../01 Data/County_Health_Rankings.csv")
